\begin{center}

% \item An operating system provides the illusion that a task runs alone on a
% given processor. This is achieved by occasionally switching between which
% tasks are run.

In the context of one processing core, \\ if more than one task is ready to
run, \\ which should get to go first?

\frametitle{Simplifying Assumptions}

Let us begin with some unrealistic assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] Each task runs for the same, fixed amount of time.

\item[2.] All tasks arrive at the same time.

\item[3.] Once started, a task runs to completion.

\item[4.] All tasks only use the CPU (i.e., perform no I/O)

% \item[5.] The wall-clock running time of each task is known.

\end{itemize}

\vspace{\fill}

Some formal consequences (more along the way):

\begin{itemize}

\item[a.] There is a fixed number of $n$ tasks in the system.

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}

A non-preemptive scheduler runs a task to completion.

\begin{center}

A preemptive scheduler interrupts a task \\ whenever there are better things to
do.
