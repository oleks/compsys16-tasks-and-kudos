\begin{description}

\item [Rule 1] If $\text{Level}(A) < \text{Level}(B)$, $A$ runs ($B$ doesn't).

\item [Rule 2] If $\text{Level}(A) = \text{Level}(B)$, $A$ \& $B$ run in RR. \\
The time-slice on level $i$ is $i\times\text{``your exam number''}$ number of
ticks.

\item [Rule 3] When a job enters the system, it is placed in queue 1.

\item [Rule 4] Once a job uses up its time-slice in the RR-scheme (see Rule 2),
it is moved down one level in the queue, unless the job finished, or it is
already on the bottom-most queue.

\item [Rule 5] After a time period of 1000 ticks, move all the jobs in the
system to the topmost queue.
